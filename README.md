# RecyTrack: A Smart Recycling Rewards System

## 🌍 Problem Statement
Recycling rates remain low due to:
- Lack of motivation
- Accessibility issues
- Poor waste segregation

Consumers find recycling inconvenient, and there are no direct incentives to encourage sustainable behavior. As a result, recyclable materials often end up in landfills, increasing pollution and wasting valuable resources.

### 📊 Severity of the Problem
- Over **2 billion tons of waste** are generated annually worldwide.
- Only **9% of plastic waste** gets recycled.
- Inefficient recycling leads to **landfill overflow, ocean pollution, and CO₂ emissions**.
